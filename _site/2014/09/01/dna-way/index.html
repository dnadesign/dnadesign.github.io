			<h1>How to do it the DNA way </h1>

<div class="post-content">
	<p>We&#39;ve been doing front end development for a while and have been seeing a couple of trends for us.</p>

<ol>
<li>Bigger and more complex jobs due to responsive and increasing online services.</li>
<li>Bigger and more diverse teams needed due to bigger jobs.</li>
</ol>

<p>This meant we needed to standardize the way we work.</p>

<p>In the past we had look at OOCSS to solve our issues however with responsive that gets quite clunky quite quickly. You 
end up with needing col-sm-1, col-md-2, col-lrg-1 etc. While that works OK-ish for grids it doesn&#39;t for much else. We 
had been using classes like f-left for float:left, however now we were going to need, sm-f-left, md-f-left, lrg-f-left 
etc. </p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t going to be fun for anyone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we&#39;d seen BEM being talked about and thought it looked a bit weird.</p>

<p>We had decided on mobile first on our first big responsive project (wellington.govt.nz), and had created a stylesheet 
for each breakpoint. Each stylesheet was getting quite large by the time Will got assigned to the job, so he introduced 
Grunt and we&#39;ve never looked back.</p>

<p>We then moved onto our next big responsive project and while Grunt was helping us keep stylesheets smaller, there was a 
lot of searching going on. It wasn&#39;t clear what bits were re-usable and which weren&#39;t. This resulted in a lot of 
coupling and some hard to maintain code.</p>

<p>We looked at BEM again. Now it made sense.</p>

<p>So we re-factored our grunt tasks, included our javascript in a component folders alongside our CSS and have recommended 
sticking to completely independent components as much as possible.</p>

<p>The goals are:
 * Separate development stylesheets for each breakpoint
 * Mobile browsers should receive their styles first.
 * One minified production stylesheet
 * Classname and breakpoint stylesheet pinpoint exactly which file needs to be edited</p>

<p>It&#39;ll probably morph a bit over time, but so far so good.</p>
