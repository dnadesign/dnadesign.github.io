Welcome to labs.dna.co.nz, a collection of showcases, code snippets, how-tos and general geekery from myself 
([@wilr](http://twitter.com/wilr)), John ([@pitchandtone](http://twitter.com/pitchandtone)) and the rest of the
[DNA](http://dna.co.nz) dev team.

We set this little blog ([Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)) up so that we could share our insights and the neat, 
exciting stuff that we get to experiment with and deploy for our clients.

Whether it's prototyping UX interactions, scaling infrastructure, application design, front end engineering patterns 
or even project management, we tackle a lot of interesting and diverse challenges during our day at DNA and it's about
time we share some of those opinions.
