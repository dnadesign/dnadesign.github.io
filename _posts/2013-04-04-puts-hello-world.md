Welcome to labs.dna.co.nz, a collection of showcases, code snippets and general geekery from me ([@wilr](http://twitter.com/wilr) and the rest of the [http://dna.co.nz](DNA) dev team. We set this little blog up so that we could share some of the neat and exciting stuff that we experiment with on a day to day basis.

Whether it be prototyping new interactions, application programming or managing infrastructure we get to tackle a lot of interesting challenges with our great clients. To make this happen we don't just consult or provide templates but we work across a magnitude of technologies (Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, Actionscript, .NET..), platforms (SilverStripe, Node, Flash, Drupal, Wordpress, Kohana, SharePoint..) and a wide spectrum of devices ranging from desktops, to touch mobile phones and interactive displays.

We look forward to sharing some of our work with you.
