Welcome to labs.dna.co.nz, a collection of showcases, code snippets, how-tos and
general geekery from myself ([@wilr](http://twitter.com/wilr)), John
([@pitchandtone](http://twitter.com/pitchandtone)) and the rest of the
[DNA](http://dna.co.nz) dev team.

We set this little blog up so that we could share our insights and some of the
neat and exciting stuff that we experiment and deploy for our clients.

Whether it's prototyping UX interactions, scaling infrastructure, application
design, front end engineering patterns or even project management, we tackle a
lot of interesting and diverse challenges. Most of which is kept behind the
scenes, discussed in the dark corners of the office because frankly, the
design team just want their grid followed, this thing to swoosh over to
fade into this and the logo bigger.

But like an iceberg, the bulk of the power (and potential for trouble) lies
below the surface.
